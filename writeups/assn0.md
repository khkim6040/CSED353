Assignment 0 Writeup
=============

My name: [Gwanho Kim]

My POVIS ID: [khkim6040]

My student ID (numeric): [20190650]

This assignment took me about [4.5] hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

My secret code from section 2.1 was: [72dfb54c13]

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: [Create my private git repository linked in assn0 description(authentication issue, different default branch name issue, cloning public repository), Spacing issue when write request in webget.cc, Inspect strange sponge codes, Errors occurred by the[-Werror=effc++] compile option]

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: [May be adding notice such as "Be careful at spacing when you write request"?]

- Optional: I was surprised by: [Massive system functions wrapping codes of sponge]

- Optional: I'm not sure about: [How portforward works, differences between socket.connect and socket.bind, What is the case where a single call to read is not enough in webget.cc? in tomahawk example, single call was enough, How to further build same interface without memory?]
